# Zone PHP
Zone PHP is a repository of my workaround and learning.
There will be a form of static-made website and scripts along with UI.

## Changelogs
A changelogs should have a topics, challenges, branches, or simply versioning.

How to write versioning:
- use ``php`` in the initial branch then ``-branch-v1-test``

### Branches
- ``main`` branch all the updates and perfectly working should be posted
- ``php-unit-testing`` would be the last branch for test cases
- ``php-dev-`` for the added branches
